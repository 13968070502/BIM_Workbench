# BIM workbench for FreeCAD

![](https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/images/5/5e/BIM_workbench_presentation.png)

This is a workbench for [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org) that implements a complete set of [Building Information Modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_information_modeling) (BIM) tools and allows a proper BIM workflow similar to professional BIM applications like Revit, ArchiCAD, AllPlan or BricsCAD.

FreeCAD is an open-source generic, parametric 3D modeling application. The BIM workbench, rather than trying to be a all-in-one, independent application and mimic the above applications, integrates into all layers of FreeCAD and allows you to use all the other moldeling and analysis tools of FreeCAD for BIM purposes too. In fact, if you know FreeCAD well already, you can do BIM without the BIM workbench, and only use it at the very end to format your model for BIM.

But one of the specific goals of this particular workbench, is to try to focus on user experience. FreeCAD is a powerful application, but has a rather steep learning curve. In the BIM workbench, we try to ease that curve somehow.

**Warning**: This is experimental work. Although it is perfectly safe to use, won't break anything, it is meant to be experimental, and not a production environment (yet). You are more than welcome to try, and help us to build a better BIM workflow, but remember that some features might change or disappear without notice over time.

### Installing

Starting from FreeCAD v0.17, the BIM workbench can easily be installed from within FreeCAD using the addons manager, found under menu Tools -> Addons manager

### Documentation

The BIM workbench documentation is hosted on the FreeCAD wiki, at https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/BIM_Workbench

### Development

The development reports I write monthly are available at https://github.com/yorikvanhavre/BIM_Workbench/wiki
